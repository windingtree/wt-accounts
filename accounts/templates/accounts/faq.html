      <dt>Can I send ETH from an exchange?</dt>
      <dd><strong style="color: red;">No, you risk to lose your money!</strong> You should only send ETH to the ICO smart contract from a wallet that can receive ERC20 tokens, like MyEtherWallet.</dd>
      <dt>I ignored your guide and sent money from an exchange. What now?</dt>
      <dd>We are sorry. The only way to receive your ETH back is to invalidate your KYC by editing your profile and providing a fake ETH address that wouldn't match any transactions we've received, e.g. <code>0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead</code>. In this case your contribution will be sent to the address it originated from.</dd>
      <dt>The exchange I sent ETH from doesn't reuse ETH addresses!</dt>
      <dd>We are sorry, but your tokens are now lost.</dd>
      <dt>I used 100,000 gas, but the transaction got rejected</dt>
      <dd>Please try higher gas amount, perhaps up to 500,000</dd>
      <dt>My transaction is not confirming for hours</dt>
      <dd>The gas price you used was not enough for a faster confirmation. Just wait, t will confirm</dd>
      <dt>I sent a transaction with 100,000 gas, but it got rejected.</dt>
      <dd>Please try higher gas amount, perhaps up to 500,000.</dd>
      <dt>Is there a minimum for contribution? A maximum?</dt>
      <dd>There is no minimum, but if you send over 15ETH you will have to take an additional step confirming your identity.</dd>
      <dt>I've contrubited in the presale in November, I sent ETH from an ERC20-compatible wallet. How do i claim my tokens?</dt>
      <dd>There is nothing you need to do. The tokens will appear in your wallet automatically.</dd>
      <dt>Do i have to add custom token to MEW?</dt>
      <dd>We're working with MEW to support Líf natively. In the meantime, you can add a custom token with these parameters. Contract address: <code>0xEB9951021698B42e4399f9cBb6267Aa35F82D59D</code> (also available via <code>token.windingtree.eth</code> or <code>lif.winidngtree.eth</code>), symbol: <code>LIF</code>, decimals: <code>18</code>.</dd>
      <dt>How can I check my token balance?</dt>
      <dd>We recommend using <a href="https://etherscan.io/">etherscan.io</a> or <a href="https://ethplorer.io/">ethplorer.io</a>.</dd>
      <dt>My token balance on the <a href="https://lif.windingtree.com/ico/profile/">contribution status</a> page is "0", while the transaction was definitely confirmed.</dt>
      <dd>Have you entered the walled address you sent ETH from? It should match! If they do, check Etherscan and Ethplorer, if tokens are in your wallet, you have nothing to worry about, perhaps some of your browser mess with the site.</dd>
